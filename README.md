# CryExport
Blender Add-on to export to CryEngine's native formats


## Limitations
CryExport will only work on Windows.
While the add-on itself can be installed in any platform where Blender also runs, it interfaces with Crytek's Resource Compiler (RC), which is only available for Windows.


## License
CryExport is licensed under GPL as all Blender Add-ons are.
